# RUPS
In this github are all the files that where changed or made during the project RUPS

ReseachZedcam+realsenseImages:
This file was used to make depth images with the Zed camera. 
These images where also tested with Open3D, sadly not getting any results.
But this was mainly used to compare the differences between the depth images from the Intel realsense and the Zed camera.
This to try and figure out the difference between the two and why one works with Open3D and the other one not
