In this github are all the files that where changed or made during the project RUPS

Making_image_depth

This file was used to make images with the Zed camera to test on Open3D.
Sadly this did not work for some reson

ReseachZedcam+realsenseImages:

This file wasused to compare the differences between the depth images from the Intel realsense and the Zed camera.
This to try and figure out the difference between the two and why one works with Open3D and the other one not
